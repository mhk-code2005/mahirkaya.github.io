    -Run server.py which will load the recommender system and wait for requests via flask
    -The recommender system uses a couple of columns from the cvs file and uses K-Clustering
    -If what the user typed in is not in the list, we use Levenshtein library to figure out likely titles 
    -Contact the server via contact_server.py

    -Created a dockerfile and built an image using "docker build -t bookrec ."
    -Built and run a docker container by using "docker run -p 8000:8000 bookrec" (Could not get the docker app to work)
    -Contacted the docker server via a python script
    -Fixed a couple bugs relating to searching and a couple book titles appearing more than once
